### This API was made to make it easier to get faculty at the University of Washington. This is a simple to use API and instructions are on the website.There are basically 4 routes: home page, specific teacher page, all faculty page (split into 8 sections), and an add faculty page. Requests are simple and a `tests.py` is provided for any guidance on using the API for GET requests. API may expand to include courses and have the API provide course information as well (per quarter).
