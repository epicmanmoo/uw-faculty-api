# uw-faculty-api

## http://www.uwfaculty-lmao.tk/ (may take a while to load up at first). This link won't work by June 2021, so I recommend just using the below link anyway.

## If you don't feel comfortable using http, feel free to use https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/ as your BASE URL. Just use this link. I don't know why you'd want to use the http one anyway.

### This API was made to make it easier to get faculty at the University of Washington. This is a simple to use API and instructions are on the website.There are basically 4 routes: home page, specific teacher page, all faculty page (split into 8 sections), and an add faculty page. Requests are simple and a `tests.py` is provided for any guidance on using the API for GET requests. API may expand to include courses and have the API provide course information as well (per quarter).
