				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>This API was made to make it easier to get a list of all faculty/staff at the UW and their positions. Though it is not perfect, it serves to display information about the requested teacher(s). The applications of this may vary on what you are trying to do. You can use this API to do many things.</p>

				<h2>How to use</h2>
				<p>There are only 4 valid endpoints for this website. One of the endpoints is this one (surprise). The other one is for getting a faculty based on the request. I'll try to explain it here. Keep note that the base url of two other endpoints is: https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/faculty/api/v1. Now, the first endpoint is a string that you provide as a parameter. A quick note: The request ignores case so it doesn't matter how you type their name. It could look something like this <a href="https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/faculty/api/v1/aNa%20mAri%20cAuCE/" target="_blank"> https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/faculty/api/v1/aNa%20mAri%20cAuCE/ </a> No, you don't actually need to put the %20 if you're making a request to the API, but if you want then that's fine. %20, if you don't know, just means a space. So what happens when you visit this endpoint? It returns one faculty member of course (and their respective details). The details are definitely not
					extensive but this API serves to get faculty for the most part. So what if you make a request like <a href="https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/faculty/api/v1/tea/" target="_blank"> https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/faculty/api/v1/tea/ </a> ? Well, you'll get back any faculty member that has a first name starting with 'tea'. Same goes for any other combination of words you can think of. The other endpoint is for getting all of the teachers. There was some 36,000 faculty if I recall correctly (retired and not). So I broke this into 8 different sections. Another quick note: these requests can take a few seconds so just a heads up. The url is as follows https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/faculty/api/v1/allfaculty/num/ Replace 'num' with any number between 1-8 and you'll see 5,000 records per page (except the last page where you'll see less because that's math) i.e. <a href="https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/faculty/api/v1/allfaculty/4/" target="_blank"> https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/faculty/api/v1/allfaculty/4/ </a>. This endpoint provides to be useful if you want to use all faculty for some sort of research or application or your own website or whatever.
                    Check out <a href="https://uwfaculty-api.herokuapp.com/addfaculty/" target="_blank"> this page </a> for more info on the last endpoint. Besides that, this is all this API can do.

				<h2>Side Notes</h2>
				<p>As stated on the UW Website: Pursuant to RCW 42.56, the UW is providing this directory information for non-commercial purposes only. Any use of the information for commercial purposes is prohibited. TL;DR: Don't try to make profit off of their directory or use my API to do so either (since it uses their directory).</p>
